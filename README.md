This project is a simple web page where you can write some stuff to display it on page. When you click "Add book" it will create a book object instance displaying book's data on screen. You will be able to mark is as read or unread. You can also delete it from the list. The app does not have memory for now so all data will be lost after quiting the page.
This project was done as an exercise while learning using The Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library
If you're just starting out I highly recommend this course!
